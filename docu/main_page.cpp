/** \mainpage Lattice Boltzmann with Neighborhood Lists
 * \subsection General
 * The project is written in C++20. The main goal is to create a datastructures
 * that enables us to be quite flexible with boundaries in a Lattice Boltzmann Simulation.
 * For this we use neighborhood lists to connect a bunch of loose populations together.
