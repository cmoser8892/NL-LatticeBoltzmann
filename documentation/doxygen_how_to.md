# Doxygen Documentation folder: 
Call "doxygen config.doxygen" in the main folder, auto generates all 
(Again execute: doxygen config.doxygen in the terminal).
Do not forget to install it though :)
If all was successful a folder "html" and "latex" should have appeared. 
To open up the documentation search for index.html in the html folder to read the documentation. 
(Or use latex up to you. I do not know how that works thou and can not give a description here.)
